Steganos: Image-based Steganography (Encoding & Decoding)

This project implements a basic steganography technique to hide and extract secret messages within images using Python. The user can choose between two delimiter types (binary or text) for encoding the message, and later decode the hidden message from the image.

Features

- Binary Delimiter: Embeds the message using binary format with customizable bit lengths (8, 16, or 32).
- Text Delimiter: Allows you to use a custom text delimiter to hide your message.
- Image Encoding & Decoding: The message can be embedded into an image and later extracted from it.
